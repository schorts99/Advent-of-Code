# Advent of Code

This repository is my personal sandbox for solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles. Instead of sticking to a single stack, I’m using this space to explore **any language, paradigm, or technique** that catches my interest.

The goal isn’t just to get the right answers — it’s to sharpen problem‑solving skills, experiment with new tools, and have fun building solutions in wildly different ways.

## 🚀 What This Repo Is About

- **A polyglot playground** — expect solutions in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, C#, Ruby, Bash, or whatever I feel like learning next.
- A place to practice:
  - Algorithmic thinking
  - Clean code
  - Performance tradeoffs
  - Readability vs. Cleverness
  - Language‑specific idioms
- A space to revisit old puzzles with new approaches or new languages.

Each year’s folder stands on its own, and each day’s solution may use a different language depending on what I’m exploring at the moment.

- Each folder under 2025/ represents a day.
- Each day contains:
  - `part-01/` and `part-02/` for the two puzzle parts
  - Solutions may vary in language and style
  - Some folders may include notes, input files, or scratch code

## 🧪 What to Expect

- Solutions in **multiple languages** — Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, Bash, etc.
- A mix of:
  - Brute-force and optimized approaches
  - Readable and clever code
  - Experiments with language features
- Occasional notes on strategy, performance, or alternative ideas

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice solving algorithmic challenges
- Explore new languages and paradigms
- Compare idiomatic patterns across stacks
- Build a personal reference of techniques
- Have fun and stay sharp year-round
